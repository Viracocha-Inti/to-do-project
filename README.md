# to-do-project

The goal of this project is to practice the skills that
I have learned so far. It will require a working knowledge of
HTML, CSS/Flexbox and Javascript. The outcome should be a
responsive webpage where one can track objectives/goals
of the day/week. This webpage will have some basic local
storage memory allocation. This memory allocation is a very
new concept so a friend assisted me in developing it.

Memory allocation is still very confusing to me even after
working on this project. Need to do more studying/research
on this topic.
